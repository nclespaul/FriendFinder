Friend Finder is an online dating app similar to E-Harmony, where the user answers a batter of questions and rates the intensity of their agreement and/or disagreement with a variety of statements.  The users responses are collected and compared against a database of potential suitors.  The logic built into the app then selects the most likely best match based on the similarity of the "friends" answers to those same questions.
